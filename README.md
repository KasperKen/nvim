# Kasperken Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Nvim configuration. Strongly influenced by this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen).

## Installation

Before using this configuration you must download packer via their [quickstart guide](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim`

 ### Sync Plugins with Packer Sync

After opening neovim you must sync your plugins with packersync command

`:PACKERSYNC`
